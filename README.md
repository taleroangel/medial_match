## üõ†Ô∏è Code Generation
Run the following commands in separate terminals and leave them running while coding so code generations happen when files change:

	dart run slang watch
	dart run build_runner watch

## üèóÔ∏è Compilation

__'flutter_native_splash'__ and __'flutter_launcher_icons'__ require building before running the application, use the following commands:

```sh
dart pub get
dart run flutter_native_splash:create
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

__slang__ and __freezed__ packages require code generation before building the application, use the following commands:
```sh
dart run slang build
dart run build_runner build
```

### Release Build
In order to relese build the app you need to precompile the SKSL shaders, you can use the provided __'flutter_01.sksl.json'__ file or provide your own via the command:
```sh
flutter run --profile --cache-sksl --purge-persistent-cache --dump-skp-on-shader-compilation
```
Trigger as much animations as you can and then press __M__ inside the command-line to export the __'flutter_01.sksl.json'__ file

Then compile the __.apk__ application using the following command
```sh
flutter build apk --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/app/output/symbols --no-track-widget-creation --release --bundle-sksl-path flutter_01.sksl.json --no-tree-shake-icons -v
```
